# Remove Skipped lines from Ansible output, and if a full TASK section has only skipped lines do not print TASK line
# Written by Todd Wells  todd@wells.ws
#
# If TASK line, put line in buffer and do not print
# Remove all skipping lines ( both with and without color coding)
# if TASK buffer empty, print line
# if TASK buffer is full and current line is blank, TASK was followed only by skipped lines.  Do not print TASK and clear buffer
# TASK buffer full and current line not blank.  TASK followed by a non-skipped line ( OK, Changed).  Print TASK, current line and clear buffer
#
# color coding can be preserved by using the environment variable option
# export ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true
# to preserve color in jenkins, https://major.io/2014/06/25/get-colorful-ansible-output-in-jenkins/
